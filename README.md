# About our project

We used the ['COVID-19 Radiography Database'](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) from Kaggle wich is a database of chest X-ray images for COVID-19 positive cases along with Normal, Viral Pneumonia and Lung Opacity images.

This dataset is composed by:
- 3,616 COVID-19 images;
- 10,192 Normal images;
- 6,012 Lung Opacity images;
- 1,345 Viral Pneumonia images.

In order to increase this data, we take some other x-ray images for COVID and Pneumonia.

 To further enhance the dataset, additional COVID-19 and Pneumonia images were incorporated, resulting in a final dataset of over 25,000 images composed by:

- 4,319 COVID-19 images;
- 10,192 Normal images;
- 6,012 Lung Opacity images;
- 4,763 Viral Pneumonia images.

The COVID-19 detection app utilizes a convolutional model to identify patterns in X-ray images. This robust dataset, combined with advanced machine learning techniques, enables the app to deliver reliable and accurate results in the detection of COVID-19.

The app has the potential to be a valuable tool in the global fight against the pandemic.
